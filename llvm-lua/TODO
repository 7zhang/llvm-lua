optimizations:
* When the internal index/limit/step variable of a OP_FORLOOP get moved to the C-Stack the space on the Lua-stack is unused.  We should be able to decrease the maxstacksize by re-using those stack slots.

Fast Function calling:
* luaD_precall: use 'goto' statement instead of a tailreturn.
* Use the 'lua_precall' hook in 'CClosure' to directly process math.* functions.
* Fast JIT->C call for math.* functions.  Add a flag to 'CClosure' structure to mark it as supporting fast calling.
